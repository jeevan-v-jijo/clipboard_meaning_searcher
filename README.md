# clipboard_meaning_searcher
This is a python program which when run allows you to automate the task of searching the meaning a word on the internet

PROBLEM ADDRESSED:  
  Whenever I read a blog or watch a video with captions on, i come across words whose meaning is unknown to me. I often had to either copy the text and paste in browser to search for meaning or had to type in myself. This would be a tedious task if there were too many unfamiliar words.
 
 SOLUTION:  
  Automate the Entire process.  
  First run the python file in an IDE.(You can also change the default app from IDE to python by changing the proerties of file and then just clicking on the resultant icon).
 Two cases:  
 1. If I having a textual file:  
      I just have to select the text and press ctrl+C this will automatically search for the text in your default browser.  
 2. If its in a picture format and cannot be copied:  
      You need windows Power Toys to be installed in your pc for this.  
      Then just press Win+Shift+T this will automatically search for the meaning of selected text.
